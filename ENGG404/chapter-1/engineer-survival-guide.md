# Engineer's Survival Guide

- Poor decisions can be made when one is pressured to make quick decisions 
  - without fully understanding the consequences of those decisions.

## Four Key Points

---

### Understand Organization Values

---

- Review organization policy, **core values and corporate ethics**
  - determine **whether safety** is a value
- When *safety* is elevated from **being a priority** to **becoming a value**,
  - it supports sustainable safety and risk management
- *Priorities change, value do not*
  - **Values** are the compass that set the culture in an organization
-  The organization has safety culture when
  - a culture where safety considerations **come ahead of any** action to complete a task
  - a culture where safety considerations are the **basis for decision making** when considering a course of action

---

### Understand Your Program

---

- Determine **if** the organization **has** a safety and risk management program
- Understand your **personal responsibility** to meet program requirements
  - and undertake those responsibilities diligently.
- People's lives and your organization's business may depend on it

---

### Safety First

---

- When you make decisions, **put safety ahead of any other objectives** (production, cost, schedule, etc.)
  - even under compelling or stressful circumstances
- People, the environment, and the organization are exposed to increased risk **when** safety takes a backseat to other objectives
- It's not a matter of "**if**" but rather "**when**" a tragic incident will occur.

---

### Pay Attention To Failures

---

- **Pay attention** to **failures** in **safety system** and **take action**
- As an engineer, you must
  - **intervene** when intended engineering controls and / or the administrative controls are
    - bypassed, de-activated,
    - fall into disrepair
    - disuse or misuse
    - fail,
    - are being circumvented (being avoid illegally)
    - ignored or not followed,
  - or otherwise become compromised in some detrimental manner.
- Engineering controls : safety equipment, sensors/controls/alarms, etc.
- Administrative controls : 
  - noncompliance with, short-cutting of, or falsifying records required by safety policies, standard,, and procedures
    - ignoring alarms or skipping steps in a critical procedure
- When such substandard conditions and/or practices occur, **you must work to correct them**
  - Accepting these variances means **you will be part** of the inevitable spiral to disaster
