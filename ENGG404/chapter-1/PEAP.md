## The Loaf of Bread Model

---

- 10 loaves of bread are made each day.
- Cost is 90 cents each.
- Selling price is $1.00. 
- One day, the baker's helper dropped a loaf.
- The profit margin on each loaf of bread is 1.00 - 0.90 = 0.10
- Dropping one loaf require **selling 10 more loaf** to make up the loss from that **dropped loaf**.
- Significant effort is required to increase production - increase time, equipment, etc.
  - How much more effort does it take to sell more loaves or reduce manufacturing costs of those loaves
  - vs. the effort to prevent the loss incident

- **If you can prevent the loss in the first place, you're in a much better financial position**
