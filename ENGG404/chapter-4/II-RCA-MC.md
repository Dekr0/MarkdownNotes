# II-RCA-MC

## Introduction

---

- Incidents do happen.
- If the causes leading to an incident are not addressed, the incident can potentially repeat itself.
- Incident Investigation (II)
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- Cause and Effect Models (C&E)
- Manage Corrective Actions (MCA)
- **All incidents are preventable**.

## Overall II-RCA-MA Work Process

---

- Incident Happens $\to$ **Incident Investigation** $\to$ **Root Cause Analysis** $\to$ **Manage Corrective Actions** $\to$ Check Process Effectiveness

- **Incident Investigation**

  - collect *evidence* relating to an event
  - the *discovery* and ascertainment of the *facts* of a loss incident

- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** 

  - determine the *causes* of an incident

- **Manage Corrective Actions**

  - manages the *corrective* and *preventative actions* that address the latent causes identified in the RCA

## When Should One Investigate an Incident

---

- When it must be reported to the government as required by law.
- Whenever there is an incident with consequences (impacts on PEAP).
- When there is some value or lesson to be learned from an incident 
  - even if there were no consequences.
- Most likely not all incidents can be investigated and managed.
- Investigations **require resources**.
  - define “**threshold criteria**” in order to assign and use resources effectively
- Some organizations may do nothing except the bare minimum as may be required by law

## Evidence Gathering

---

- When gathering evidence, time is **most important**
- Evidence can reveal what happened and how, 
  - but evidence can **deteriorate**, or **degrade**, or **disappear** with time
- Evidence is captured in four areas known as the “four P’s”
  - each evidence type will **disappear** or become **disturbed** if not “**frozen**” or **preserved**

---

- ***Position evidence*** is destroyed in minutes if the first people on the scene are unaware of preservation techniques
  - important that the **scene is taped off immediately** after an incident and **entry restricted**

---

- People talk amongst themselves and modify their observations accordingly or even forget “short term” memory information

---

- Parts will be disturbed or thrown away, fracture surfaces contaminated
