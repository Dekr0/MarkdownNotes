# The Anatomy Of An Incident

## Basic Definition

---

- **Loss Incident**, an unplanned, undesired specific event or sequence of events that that has resulted in harm to **PEAP**.
- **Loss** is the description (quantitative and/or qualitative) of the consequences or impact of an event or incident on **PEAP**.
- An **incident** is an unintended event with negative consequences.
- The **incident description** must be clearly and correctly defined and stated 
  - to ensure a successful and rigorous root cause analysis / investigation

---

### Activity, Hazards, Consequences

---

- An **activity** describes a situation where things are being done.
  - often associated with hazards
  - can describe 
    - a task or job being performed by a person
    - a complex set of unit process operations in an industrial facility

- **<u>Hazards</u>** are "things" that can do harm, and help inform about "**What can go wrong**"

- **<u>Consequence</u>** is "**How bad it can be**" if something goes wrong
  - impacts on PEAP, or losses


---

## Type of Incident

---

- **Sporadic**, a sudden unexpected change in the status quo resulting in loss.
  - tend to be sudden and often dramatic,
  - usually these demand immediate attention.
- **Chronic**, a long-standing condition that 
  - has not been corrected yet 
  - and repeatedly results in loss and interruption to service or production.
- Sometimes, chronic situation becomes the status quo
  - managers begin to  accept it as normal
    - *organizational complacency* or *normalization of deviance*
    - symptom of an unhealthy organization with a failing management system
- **Workplace** (Occupational) Safety
- **Process Safety**

## The Incident Model - Injury Triangle

---

- The incident mode is combination (a set of circumstances $\to$ incident) of
  - **The Release of Energy or Source of Energy**
  - **In the Line-of-Fire**
  - **No Safeguards** / **Control Measures**
- The Release of Energy or Source of Energy
  - Chemical : toxic, corrosive, flammable, explosive, reactive, oxygen deficient atmospheres
  - Pressure : pressurized gases or liquids
  - Electrical : in live circuits or in stored systems (batteries, capacitators)
  - Potential / gravitational : able to fall to same or lower level
- In the Line-of-Fire (no safe distance, separation, space, intentional or not)
  - presence of a body, object, material, etc. that can be impacted and harmed by the uncontrolled release of energy
  - a person, asset, etc.
- No safeguards / Control measures (inadequate, defective, ineffective, or lack of)
  - personal protective equipment
  - engineered systems, designed
  - administrative controls (policies, procedures, check-list)
  - etc.

- A loss incident will result when all three conditions are fulfilled.

---

#### Safeguard

---

- Consider this under either circumstance where the person intends or  does not intend to be in the line of fire.
- Lack of / inadequacy of a safeguard can result in any one of the following
  - an uncontrolled release of energy
  - an unintended exposure to a source of energy
  - a  person or equipment / asset is in the line of fire of a controlled release of energy

---

### Application of The Incident Model

---

- **The discovery approach**
- Answering the following question
- What was the energy source ?
  - Look for the **source**
  - How / what can cause or **initiate** the controlled or uncontrolled **release** of an energy source ?
- Who / What was in the line of fire ?
  - Look for people, assets, and environment that **can be harmed** by a release of the **energy source**
  - How / What can **put** someone or something into the **line of fire** ?
- What was the loss of control ?
  - Look for the **inadequate control measures** that are 
    - preventing / limiting / controlling exposure to the energy source
    - keeping someone / something out of the line of fire
  - How / What can **defeat a control measure**
    - overrides / short-cuts on control measures
    - intentional / unintentional exposure to a protected / unprotected energy source

---

## Situational Awareness

---

- A key skill in monitoring for hazards (both workers and leaders)

- Recognize the presence of danger (hazard recognition)

  - first step in situational awareness

- Relentless, almost continuous, assessment of a person's surrounding for potential and actual hazards

- Judge the level of danger posed by the hazard (risk perception)

- Decide how to behave around the hazard (risk tolerance)
