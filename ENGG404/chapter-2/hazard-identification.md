# Hazard Identification

- A hazard is **any source** of **potential damage**, harm or adverse health effects on something or someone.
- In most cases, loss incidents occur because the hazard was not recognized 
  - or because the safety measures were inadequate or non-existent.

## Differentiating Between a Hazard, Severity of Hazard, and Impact on PEAP

---

- A hazard and the consequence / severity of a hazard are quiet closely aligned.
  - *Noise* can be a **hazard**, but as the *loudness* increases, the **severity of the hazard** increases.

- Lost organization reputation, fatalities and disabling injuries, environment impact, and insurance cost impacts are **not hazards.**
  - They are **consequences** of a loss incident (impact on PEAP)

- An **energy source** can be viewed as a **hazard**
- Some means or mechanism that is intended to contain energy or control energy is 
  - defective, deficient, inadequate or absent.
  - This is a hazard
  - Those means / mechanism has the potential to cause the source of energy to 
    - **uncontained**
    - or **be released uncontrollably**.
