# Unions And Industrial Relations

## Collective Bargaining

------

- The process by which a union, on behalf of its members, and an employer reach a negotiated agreement called a *collective agreement*.
- A *collective agreement* defines
  - specific time period wages
  - work hours and schedules
  - benefits
  - other working conditions
  - procedures for resolving grievances (complaint on being treated unfairly)

------

## Managers of Discontent

------

- discontent, a feeling of wanting better treatment
- Unions function as *managers of discontent*.
- Unions channel the frustrations and complaints of workers into a carefully regulated dispute-resolution system.
  - Articulating problems and needs
  - Solutions are the sought through collective bargaining.
- Unions operate in ways that contribute to 
  - the **maintenance of capitalism**
  - **reduce power imbalances** favouring owners and managers

------

### **Union Democracy **

------

- Unions are democratic organizations whose constitutions allow members to elect their leaders.
- Union leaders are responsive and accountable to the union members who elected them, translating their wishes into tangible collective bargaining goals.
- Michels' discovered issues on union democracy and the iron law of oligarchy was not a universal trait of unions.
  - a potential problem faced by all large bureaucratic organizations.
  - strong movements challenging entrenched union leadership cliques in Canada.

------

## **Business Unionism**

------

- Emphasis on material gain rather than job control
  - Increasing work / financial rewards
  - Dominates NA labour movement
- Employers are sometimes willing to give up more of their profits rather than concede to workers' greater decision-making authority.

------

## Social Unionism

------

- Broader agenda of societal reform
  - Entering public debates about globalization, human rights, health care reform
  - Social movement unionism

------

## Freeman and Medoff

------

- *Monopoly* face represents unions' power to raise members' wages
  - expense of employers and nonunionized workers
- *Collective voice* face shits attention to how unions democratize authoritarian workplaces.
  - give workers a collective voice in dealing with management.
- Unions' positive contributions out weight the social and economic costs.
- Unions advance workers' economic and political rights and freedoms.

------

## Three Waves of Unionization

------

### Craft Unionism (First Wave)

------

- Skilled craftworkers were the first to unionize in Canada.

  - Dominated the young Canadian labour movement

- Hallmarks of Craft unions

  - Craft pride based on the special skills acquired through a long apprenticeship
  - Solidarity with fellow artisans
  - Close integration work and communities

  

- Craft unions served as benevolent societies

  - providing members with a form of social insurance

- Craft unions protected their members' position in the labour market by 

  - regulating access to the craft (*labour market shelter*)



- **Union gains** but labour legislation very weak and little bargaining power
- **1919 Winnipeg General Strike**

------

### Industrial Unionism (Second Wave)

------

- All workers in an industry are represented by the same union regardless of their occupation.
  - Key industries - "primary", "goods" production
  - Strong growth a part of post WWII boom

- Became firmly established in Canada in 1940s 
  - UAW's milestone victory against GMO
  - Legislation on CB, labour practices for private sector set IR framework
- Craft and industrial unions uniting skilled and unskilled workers within a single central labour organization: CLC.
  - Oversees economic, political and organizational interests of affiliated union
  - Eliminating jurisdictional conflicts (raiding)

------

### Public Sector Unions (Third Wave)

------

- Formerly "associations", not "unions"
  - Focused on professional standards and education
  - Did not bargain for working condition
  - Many "female-dominant" occupations
- Growing militancy in 1960s to right to collective agreements and right to strike (for some)

------

## Rand Formula

------

- The *Rand Formula* provided for union security through a *union shop* and *union dues checkoff*.
- It is justifiable to automatically deduct union dues form the paycheques of all employees in a workplace.
  - Dues, official payments you make to an organization that you belong to.
- It is because a union must act for the benefit of all employees.

------

## Union Density

------

- *Union Density*: proportion of actual union members to potential members.



- Canadian union density peaked at 37% in 1984.
- Decline over the next three decades due to number of recessions and industrial restructuring.
- These both cut deeply into the traditional membership strength of unions in manufacturing and other blue-collar occupations.
- Periodic-budget cuts and downsizing in the public sector in 1990s led to lower union density.

------

### Canadian Union Patterns

------

- More female union members than male
  - Reversal of historical trend
  - Public-sector unions
- Young workers underrepresented in unions

------

### Comparative Perspectives

------

- Canada higher than US, UK but lower than Scandinavian countries.
  - General decline in industrialized countries
- Better **collective bargaining coverage** in Europe
  - More non-union members covered

------

## Free-Rider Problem

------

- Individuals will not naturally organize to further their collective interest.
- "The rational worker" will not voluntarily contribute to a union providing a collective benefit since 
  - [s]he alone would not perceptibly strengthen the union.
  - [s]he would get the benefits of any union achievements whether or not [s]he supported the union.

------

## Albert Hirschman

------

- *exit* and *voice* method of expressing discontent highlights the second dilemma.
- A dissatisfied employee can either leave the employer or stay and push for changes.
- The presence of a union increases the chances that the employee will pursue the latter strategy.
- Non-union workplaces, the poor employment conditions that could 
  - spark an organizing drive
  - increase the chances of an individual opting to quit the job and look for another one
  - major obstacle to unionization in low-wage job

------

## Strike and Lockout

------

### Strike

------

- Workers deliberately stop working in order to try to force their employer to agree to some set of demands.

- Require a high degree of mobilization

  - Planned collective strategy

- Not be much support strike until a vocabulary has developoed to justify such action.

  

- *Wildcat* strikes : unauthorized strikes during the term of an agreement, often spontaneous responses by ordinary workers to an immediate problem in the workplace.

  

- *Sympathy* strikes

  

- *Rotating* strikes, *working-to-rule* (doing the min. required or refusing over-time work), or staging work stoppages by "sitting down" on the job are variants of strike activity.

  - communicate workers' demands to management.

------

### Lockout

------

- *Lockout*, employers refuse to let workers come to work
