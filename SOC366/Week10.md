# Week 10 : Gender And Paid Employment

- Cohen's research underlines the importance of examining
  - how the **public and private spheres** of market and household 
  - have been intertwined in diverse ways during all phases of economic development,
    - (connected closely so as to be difficult to separate)
  - with women always performing central and important roles,
  - although quite different from those performed by men.

---

## Context

---

- In late 19th-century Canada, only a fraction of women were engaged in paid employment.
  - But as factories sprang up in the late 19th century, women's economic role is redefined.
    - cheap unskilled or semiskilled labourers
- Early-20th-century attitude about women's economic roles distinguish between
  - single and married.
- **Industrialization** accentuated age and gender divisions in the economy.
  - accentuated : emphasize a particular feature of something
- Virtually, all industrialized nations have experienced rising *female labour force participation rates* since the end of WW II

---

## Social Reproduction

---

- The *unpaid domestic labour* of women raising the future generation of workers and 
  - feeding, clothing, and caring
- for the present generation of workers was as essential function within capitalism.

---

## The Family Wage

---

- Powerful social values justified this division of labour.
- Especially influential in perpetuating women's subordinate role as unpaid family workers was the ***Ideology of the family wage***.
  - perpetuating : cause something to continue.
- Action reinforcing such ideology
  - wages should be high enough for a male to support a wife and children
    - reducing women's presence drastically
    - and cheap labour they provided.
  - lobbied for restrictions on female industrial employment
    - due to harmful personal and social effects.
  - limited hiring mainly to single women.
- The cost of this was 
  - female dependence
  - the restriction of women's labour market opportunities to are where they did not compete directly with men.
    - aka ***male breadwinner***.

------

## Opt Out

------

- Context : How women make choices and trade-offs between
  - employment, marriage and child rearing 
  - has been the subject of much debate.
- Highly educated women are choosing motherhood over paid work.
  - ***Opt Out***

---

## Female Job Ghettos

---

- Ghettos : an area of a city, especially a very poor area, 
  - where people of a particular race or religion 
  - live closely together and apart from other people.
- Female *job ghettos* offer little economic security and opportunities for advancement.
- Work is often unpleasant, boring, and sometimes physically taxing
- Lack ready access to the more challenging and lucrative occupations
- The concepts of ghettos and shelters emphasize 
  - the unequal rewards and opportunities built into the job market on the basis of a worker's sex.

---

## Gender Segregation

---

- ***Horizontal*** occupational gender segregation is segregation across different occupations.
- ***Vertical*** segregation : a obstacle women face.
  - Involves the gendered division of status,
  - responsibilities,
  - and tasks within specific occupations.
- Men tend to have positions of greater authority in organizations => better job rewards than women.
  - Teaching profession
    - university /  college
    - high school,
    - educational administrations.
- Women have made significant inroads (start to have a direct and noticeable effect) recently in
  - law, medicine, dentistry, and business (bank).
- They predominated in lower-status specialties such as family law or general medical practice.
  - Reinforce the pattern and traditional assumption : 
    - "natural skill" as caregiver and mother.
- Obstacles despite of breakthroughs :
  - Women are far more likely to leave the profession due to 
    - work-family conflict, low pay, and discrimination (law career)
  - disadvantage with respect to mentoring and promontion
    - difficult to keep moving up the ranks
- Trend :
  - Low presence in 
    - natural science and engineering
    - the mining and oil sector
    - transporataion

  - Lower representation in management
  - far less likely to be among top earners
  - difficulties in executive and board levels.


---

## Glass Ceiling

---

- Barriers to advancement that persist despite formal policies designed to eliminate them.

---

## Wage Gap

---

- One obvious consequence of labour market segmentation.
  - Also known as *Female-male earnings ratio*
  - *Female earnings* / *Male earnings*
- Wag gap only narrowed by 9% points from 1980 to 1995, and has remained in low 70% range.
- Expansion of female employment at the lower end of the pay scale offset the trend.
  - It reduces the earning potential of many women.

---

## Wage Discrimination

---

- One forms of discrimination affect female earnings.
- An employer pays a woman less than a man for performing the same job
- Another forms of discrimination is occupational gender segregation mentioned above. 
  - Channelling women into low-paying job ghettos which,
  - provide few opportunities for mobility into more rewarding jobs.
- Human capital theory emphasizes that education is the great equalizer in the job market.
  - Identical educational credentials = 
  - same amount of human capital = 
  - equally competitive in earning power
  - not true (Chapter 5)
- Women have become better educated.
  - enter wider range of programs
  - increasing numbers go on to graduate studies.
  - dramatic gains in male-dominated professional faculties

---

## Gender Role Socialization

---

- The socialization of girls and boys into traditional gender roles creates 
  - cultural norms and expectations
  - that they will carry into the workplace as adults.
- Although the girls recognized the expanding occupational horizons of women
  - at a personal level, they still held traditional aspirations.
- When they imagined themselves as adults, most saw women 
  - who were mothers with small children, supported by a husband.
- More recently, young women's occupational aspirations have widened,
  - they are still shaped by fairly traditional messages,
  - especially with respect combining work and motherhood.

---

## Gendered Organizations

---

- Main sources of gender inequality.
- Typical behaviour of women in organizations that have been used to reflect 
  - either biologically based psychological attributes or
  - characteristics developed through a long socialization to the female sex role
- turn out to reflect very reasonable and very universal responses to current organizational situations.

---

### Homophily

---

- How management is a social process that relies heavily on trust and conformity.
- Mangers recruit and promote people like themselves, *homophily*.
- This social cloning reproduces male dominance in management
  - creating enormous barriers for women.
- While "managers" thus become equated with "men",
  - the role secretary draws on female stereotypes
  - *office wife* $\to$ dependency of managers and personal loyalties 

---

### Tokenism

---

- Women who do succeed in entering management face the problem of *tokenism*
- Goldfish bowl phenomenon, resulting from being an identifiable minority,
  - means women or members of visible minorities must work harder to demonstrate their competence
    - the "prove it again" pattern.
- Part of being a numerical minority.
- Tokenism is specific to women in traditionally male occupations.
- May actually benefit for men in non-traditional jobs.
