### Radical - originate Marxism

---

- Marx predicates that increase in crisis due to 
  - concentration and monopoly (complete control of something) power

  - workers will eventually 
    - develop class consciousness, 
    - cease the mean of production,
    - and control them collectively.

---

#### Question of Marx prediction:

---

-     This doesn't happen over numerous of countries.
-     Why countries emphasize reforms over radicalism in 20th century ?

---

#### Michael Mann's study

---

- Subjective alienation will eventually arise from objective condition
  - production becomes more and more centralized
  - more and more people get layoff
  - work gets more and more degraded
- Under what condition subjective alienation arise and lead to class consciousness that leads to revolution action
  - Identity of itself
  - Sense of opposition - capitalism and capitalist as opponents
  - Totality -identity and opposition are one major determinant of one life chances
  - Sense of alternative
