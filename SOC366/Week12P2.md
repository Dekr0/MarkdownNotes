# Job Satisfaction, Alienation, and Work-Related Stress

## Job Satisfaction

---

### Age

---

- *Aging effect* : older workers have reduced their expectation
  - becoming more accepting relatively unrewarding work
- *Cohort* : older workers grew up in an era
  - when it was enough to have a secure job 
  - and when little self-fulfillment at work was expected.

- *life-cycle* : older workers are more likely to have family and community interest 
  - that might compensate for dissatisfying work

- *Job effect* : older people have been 
  - promoted into more rewarding and satisfying jobs
  - or have changed jobs until they found one they liked

- *self selection* : 
  - less satisfied workers will drop out the labour force as they get older
  - leaving behind more satisfied


---

### Gender

---

- **Little difference between men and women in self-reported job satisfaction**.
- Types of jobs women hold and roles women have outside the workplace are important
  - Gender differences in work orientations not as significant.


---

### Education

---

- Human capital theory
  - higher education = a better job = more jobs satisfaction
    - not all well-educated workers will have good jobs
- Better educated workers might with higher expectations regarding careers
- Job satisfaction studies completed in 1970s and 1980s typically found that education had little effect on job satisfaction
  - higher education = a better job and higher education = higher expectation cancel each other

---

## Work Rewards

---

- Differences in job characteristics and rewards are typically more directly linked to job satisfaction.
- *extrinsic work rewards* : pay, benefits, promotion opportunities, job security, etc. 
- *intrinsic work rewards* : autonomy, challenge, skill-use, etc.

---

### Herzberg's Two Factor Theory

---

- ***Hygiene factors***, 
  - such as pay, supervisory style, and physical surroundings in the workplace, 
  - could reduce job dissatisfaction.
- Only ***motivators***, 
  - such as opportunities to develop one's skills and to make decisions about one's own work,
  - could increase job satisfaction

### Kallberg's Six Dimensions of Work

---

- *Intrinsic reward dimension*, 
  - emphasizes interesting, challenging, and self-directed work that 
  - allows personal growth and development.
- *Career opportunities dimension*
- *Financial rewards dimension*
  - pay, job, security, fringe benefits
- Resource Adequacy
  - availability of information, tools, and materials necessary to do a job

## Alienation and Freedom

---

### Robert Blauner

---

- Alienation : 
  - powerlessness, meaninglessness, isolation, and self-estrangement.
- Technology is a major determinant of the degree of alienation experienced at work.
- Technology / work organization -> Skill level -> subjective sense of alienation

---

#### Alienation Related to Skill

---

- Unskilled workers (Example : automobile assembly line workers)
  - Job Attributes
    - Little control over product
    - Little control over work process
    - No sense of pride in skills or final products
    - Little social interaction with co-workers
  - Market Attributes
    - Easily replaceable, no security
    - Strong competition for jobs
    - Conflictual relations with management
- Skilled Workers (Example : printers)
  - Job Attributes
    - High degree of control over process
    - Strong sense of skill and accomplishment
    - Strong sense of community with co-workers
    - Relatively good relations with management
  - Market Attributes
    - High job security <- not easily replaceable
    - Strong unions

---

## Work-Related Stress

---

- Notice that it is possible to feel dissatisfied with work, without experiencing a great deal of stress.
- Work-related stress 
  - physical and mental symptoms
- It can also accumulate to the point of *burnout*
  - an individual is unable to cope in the job.

---

## Demand Control Model

---

- Active jobs : high decision-making potential
- Passive jobs : low decision-making potential
- High psychological demands + high control = less stress
- High psychological demands + low control = stress (+ potential for physical and psychological ill health)
