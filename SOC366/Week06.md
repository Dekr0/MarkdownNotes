# Innovation & Failure

## Innovation

------

- How do organizations change and innovate to avoid failure without exposing themselves to increased risk of failure?

------

### Sociological Approach

------

- Certain structural characteristics of organizations and networks lead to innovation
- **Environment** = setting in which organizations act
  - Regulation, standards, competition, resources
  - Innovation and developments from universities, government labs, and other firms

------

### Network Approaches

------

- Structural Holes (Burt 1992)
  - Position in network structure determines success
    - Brokering positions pay off
  - Structural holes generate lots of value, novel combination of ideas that breed creativity
- Small World Networks (Watts 2004)
  - Highly connected but with some bridges
  - Facilitates trust and cooperation

------

### Organizational Characteristics

------

- Firm age & size
  - Inertia, capacity to endure change
  - Competence, ability to accomplish goals
- Structure
  - How information is stored
  - How information flows

------

### Environment

------

- Resource dependence theory
  - Organizations depend on other organizations for resources
  - Power relations among those organizations shape behavior and outcomes
- Institutional landscape
  - Government, education systems, regulatory bodies, professional / occupational associations, social movements.

## Failure

------

- Failure, deviance from organizational goals and normative standards to produce a suboptimal outcome.
- **Mistakes,** actions / events with contained social costs
  - Injury, small property damage, a single unintended death
- **Misconduct**, violation of rules, laws, regulations to serve organization with variable public cost
  - white-collar crimes, illegal dumping
- **Disasters**, surprising and profound alteration of social life, with large-scale costly and public consequences
  - nuclear reactor meltdowns, dam collapses, plane crashes
- Place for failures to emerge
  - Cognition (**Decision-making**)
  - Organizations / Tasks / Process
  - Environment

------

### Cognition / Decision-Making

------

- Limits to rationality (lack of perfect information)
- Contexts inform decision-making
  - Cultural knowledge reduces complexity for decision-making but introduces potential for error
- Example
  - Difficult to identify child abuse for social workers because it requires costly observations, which are not public and obscured
  - Cost / benefit calculations over the cost of complying with regulations

------

### Organizations

------

- **Institutional isomorphism** 
  - Not all structures are rational
  - instead reflect legitimating (reasonable and acceptable) processes
    - organizations incorporate the 'myths' of success within their field, even if it is not efficient or effective
- **Excessive formalization**
  - Strict rules may prohibit adaption / introduce complexity
  - Structural Secrecy (the state of being secret)
- **Culture**
  - Socialized into company or occupational **culture** that may **excuse poor behavior**
- **Process & Tasks**
  - **Informal practices** at work may undermine organizational goals
  - Governed by tacit knowledge or rules emerge only after the fact

- Examples
  - Medical diagnosis relies on a series of tasks aimed at assessing the human body
    - uncertain and imprecise
  - Manipulation of accounting practices to inflate value of the company
  - Excessive risk-taking encouraged by CEOs and higher management

------

### Environments

------

- **Resources**
  - Strain theory: blocked access to opportunity may lead companies to violate laws and regulations.
- **Cultures**
  - Non-compliance, competition, risk taking
- Examples
  - **reduced** government funding for hospitals puts pressures on hospitals to reduce staff which results in **poor supervision** and **mistakes**.
  - **increased mortality** may be seen as a disaster

------

### Disaster

------

- Normal accidents
  - Complexity of system : interrelationships within the system
  - Coupling of process : the extend to which systems are linked to one another
- High reliability organizations
  - Cultural factors can offset conditions of 'normal accidents'
