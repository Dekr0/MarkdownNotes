- Rule of Thumb : workers tend to pass down the experience to the new workers
  - Employers don't know/control the work process

------

1. Management should plan and direct all work activities

2. Breakdown tasks to simplest routine

3. Evaluate workers to best match them for specific job; train and monitor their work

4. Premium for performing work as told

## Welfare Capitalism

------

- Economic rewards in exchange for loyalty to the company

  - Money for dull/hard work (working condition is still very brutal)
  - Quitting/getting fired unpleasant or very costly

- Fringe benefits

  - Stock
  - Paid vacation
  - Housing

------

## Solidification of Fordism

------

- Government intervened on the behalf of worker 
  - give the workers right to organize
  - prohibit employers firing workers because of union organizing

- The clearest way of a company to ensure loyalty to firms from the great depression is *job security*
