- Characteristic that set apart algorithmic control from other types of control
  - More comprehensive data to control people

  - Instantaneous (feedback)
  - Interactive
  - Opaque
    - require solid technological background to understand and implement
    - information hiding and encapsulation such that employees 
      - do not know how is implemented, tested and used.
