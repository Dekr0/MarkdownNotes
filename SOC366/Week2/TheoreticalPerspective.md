## Neoclassical Economics

------

- Capitalism characterized by the following :
  - Private ownership
  - Minimal state intervention
  - Voluntary exchange
  - Markets
  - Price determined by market
- Characteristic of capitalism will lead to **wealth & societal prosperity**
- Competition can result spurs innovation & growth
- Division of Labour
  - How tasks are organized and distributed among workers
  - Central to greater productivity & wealth
- Capitalism could lead to exploitation, especially during periods of economic decline
- Smith suggested high wages to improve productivity of workers
- Uneven conceptualization / accounts of human action

------

#### Invisible hand of market

------

- Individual self-interest creates social benefits
- Price mechanism spurs optimal allocation

------

## Marx's Critique

------

- Historical analysis of the capitalist mode of production
- Problem of alienation (how human condition is distorted under capitalism) from work
- The dominant ideal ideology rises from the working classes to support the dominant mode of production at the time
- Division of labor = surplus value, exploitation, loss of worker control, and alienation 

------

#### Humanistic Worldview

------

- Humans find meaning and purpose in work, which can be put to infinite use.

------

#### Historical Materialism

------

- First historical act : production of subsistence (the state of having what a person (basic) needs in order to stay alive but no more)
- Materialism : the arrangements of producing necessities of life

------

#### Means of production

------

- The type of technology and materials to produce goods
- Deployment of tools, technologies, know-how, raw materials, labor power, skills, information, land

------

#### Social Relations of production

------

- The actual ways of which the technology is used and materials is combined are depended on the social relations
- How humans interact and cooperate with one another to produce subsistence
  - people participate in production have right and power over the input and the result of their uses

- *Means* + *Relations* = *Mode*

------

#### Capitalist relations of production

------

- **Private ownership** (over capital, not powers and rights) : rights of exclusion
- **Capital** : inputs of production
- Creation of a **wage labor market**
- Workers belong to those who buy them (**labor power**) 
- Workers and Capitalist don't share the common goal ?

------

- **Surplus Expropriation**
  - Wages < Exchange Value
  - Profit goes to owner to enjoy or reinvest
- **Exploitation**, 
  - Material welfare of exploiter causally depends on the material deprivation of the exploited
- **Division of Labour**
  -  owners vs. workers
  - Tasks broken down into component parts for unskilled workers to maximize the efficient and the profit
    - avoid hiring expensive high skill workers
  - Competition drives increasing division
  - Benefits go to capitalist class
- This lead to class conflict = inevitable result of capitalism
- Capitalism ‘**alienates**’ labor from the essence of human ‘species being’ by
  - Alienation of the worker from his/her product
  - Alienation of the worker from process of production
  - Self-estrangement
  - Alienation of workers from each other and their employers

------

## Max Weber

------

- Economic development is deeply affected by norm values and culture ideas in a territory. 
- Work + Asceticism = Capital Accumulation 
  - Accumulate - to collect a large number of things over a long period of time
- Asceticism - the practice of living a simple life without physical pleasures, often for religious reasons
- **Power** - the chances a man or a group of men have to realize their will in a communal action, even against the opposition of others taking part in it
- **Market** - exchange in pursuit of profit
  - Class situation: shared economic interests in market exchange
  - Resources that you bring to the market determine life chances
