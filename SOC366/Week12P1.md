## Instrumental Work Orientations

  - more pronounced in industries where **large differences** between **management and workers** in terms of 
    - income,
    - power,
    - and opportunities for upward mobility has produced heightened class consciousness.
- *Deferential workers* also recognized class differences,
  - but **accepted** the **status quo**,
  - believing that **wealth and power inequities** were **justified**. '
- *Instrumental work orientations*, was more typical of the work attitudes of the contemporary (happen right now) working class
  - *privatized workers*.
  - **Work** was simply **a way to obtain** a **better standard of living**
  - an "*instrument*" used to achieve other non-work goals.
