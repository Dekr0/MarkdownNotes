# Labour Markets, Opportunity & Inequality

- *Labour Market* is 
  - the arenas in which workers exchange their labor power in return for wages, status, and other job rewards.
  - the institutions and practices that govern the purchase, sale, and pricing of labor services.

------

## Human Capital Model (Theory)

------

- a major explanation of how today's labour market operates.
  - How are opportunity and inequality **distributed**?
  - Who earns what, and why they earns it?
  - What "value" does society place on specific jobs?
  - Does "getting an education" pay off?
  - Who "gets ahead" in the career race, and why they can do so?
  - How are labour markets and social inequality changing overtime?
- The skills the labor force possesses and is regarded as a resource or asset.
- Theory suggests that better-education individual generally are
  -  less likely to be unemployed
  -  and more likely to hold well-paying, high-status jobs.
  - i.e. **School imparts skills that will command more rewards in the labor market**
- Theory assumes that labour market participants are all competing for jobs in a single, open labour market.
  - Information is widely circulated.
  - Employers make rational hiring decision based on each individuals ability
- Theory suggests that investment in human capital = higher returns
- Meritocracy
  - best people match to best jobs
  - individuals and society best served.

### Critic on Human Capital Theory

------

- No good measure of skill
- Contrary evidence on better-education = better job
- Overlooks the behavior and characteristic of employers and work organizations (demand side, worker -> supply side)

------

### Social Structure & Occupational Choice

------

- Question toward human capital model's assumption
  - To what extent to individuals really have a choice from a wide range of jobs?
  - Does everyone start the "career race" from the same position?
  - Does chance play a role in career choices?
  - Influence of socioeconomic origins on career patterns
    - Children of wealthy people working as a bus drivers
  - Other factor, personal attributes (gender, race, and ethnicity)

------

### Equality of Educational Opportunity

------

- Gender, ethnicity, family background, region  of residence, or other individual characteristics should not be an impediment (achieving something difficult or impossible) to obtaining a good education, and, through this, access to good jobs

  

- **Ascription**, placement beyond control of the individual

- **Achievement**, placement based on individual merits

------

#### Intergenerational Transfer of Advantage

------

- More youth from high-income families were attending university, compared to those from low-income families (Canada, 2007).
- Studies that focus on parents' education, rather than their income, show even larger differences.
- Coming from a a family with a tradition of university attendance substantially increases the chances of completing university oneself.

------

### Cultural Capital (Pierre Bourdieu)

------

- *Cultural capital*: familiarity with the dominant culture; skills, knowledge

  

- Lower-class students disadvantaged in the classroom because they don't possess cultural capital, but the education system assumes it.

- Middle-class youth bring more of this culture capital to school with them, and so have a distinct advantage.

- Schools encourage and reward the language, beliefs, behaviour, competencies of the more powerful groups in society.

- School are not neutral institutions

  - part of the process whereby structural inequalities and power differences within society are reproduced


------

## Labour Market Segmentation

------

- Question single, open labour market
  - Different industries / employers offer work opportunities that differ in rewards.
- Emphasizes the barriers that limit access to the primary labour market for many qualified individuals
  - restricted movement between labour market sectors (such as *secondary* to *primary*)
- Emphasizes the ability of participants in primary labour market to maintain their more advantaged position.
- Three varieties of this research

------

### Dual Economies

------

- how capitalist economies changed in the 20th century
- *Core sector*
  - Large, powerful companies; also government
  - Higher productivity / profit
  - Capital intensive
  - More often unionized
  - Contains a *Primary labour market*
    - higher wages
    - better benefits
    - more job security
    - better working condition
    - more career opportunities
- *Periphery sector*
  - Smaller, more competitive firms;also self-employment
  - Lower productivity / profit
  - Labour-intensive
  - Less often unionized
  - Contains a *secondary labour market*
    - lower wages
    - few benefits
    - more frequent unemployement
    - poor working conditions
    - more "dead-end" jobs

------

### Internal Labour Markets

------

- Well-developed internal training and promotion system, *internal labour market*
- *Ports of entry*
  - limited number of entry-level jobs that are typically the only way into such an internal labour market
- *Mobility chains* (career ladders)
  - employees make their way during their career within the organization
- Assume all core-sector firms contain well-developed internal labour markets.

------

### Social Closure Theory

------

- Improve job and income security by setting up *labour market shelters* (union and professional associations)

- Social groups create boundaries in the division of labor and seek to maximize influence over those areas
  - Draw boundaries
    - *Professions*
      - require specialized knowledge through formal education in professional schools (Engineers, doctors, etc.)
  - Keep up demand
    - Industrial unions bargain collectively with employers to determine seniority rules, promotion procedures, and pay rates.
  - Legitimate provider
    - high level of work autonomy
    - self-regulating
    - policing themselves through their own professional associations
  - Convince others that they can perform the occupation
- Randall users the term *market closure* to describe the ability of professionals to shape the labour market to their advantages.

------

## Labour Market Polarization

------

- Many of the new jobs created have been part time / temporary than the full-time, permanent jobs that have disappeared.
  - paying less
  - fewer benefits
  - fewer career opportunities
- Nonstandard jobs with less security have been increasing
  - *temporary foreign workers*
    - labour force situation is more precarious due to
      - no Canadian citizenship
      - not protected by labour legislation
- More Canadians unemployed and relatively fewer people employed in the well-paying, full-time, permanent jobs that were once taken for granted.
  - Primary labour market shrank during the 1990s
