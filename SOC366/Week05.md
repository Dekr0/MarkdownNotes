# Structuring Work

## Marx and Employment Relationships

------

### Surplus Value

------

- Marx observed that wage-labourers produced more than the amount needed to pay their wages.
- Therefore, *Surplus value* was being created.
  - Employers were exploiting workers by keeping the profits from their labour.
- By purchasing labour, capitalists gained control over the labour process itself.

------

### Forms Of Alienation

------

- Products did not belong to those who produced them
  - but rather to those
    - who owned the enterprise
    - and who purchased the labour of workers
- Decision about what to produce and who to sell the finished products were not made by the workers.
- Profit generated in the exchange remained with the owners of the enterprise.
- Transfer of control over the labour process from individual workers to capitalists or mangers meant that
  - workers lost the chance to make decisions about how the work should be done.
- Extensive fragmentation of the work process had taken away most intrinsic work rewards.
- Separation of individual workers from others around them.
- Work was transformed from a creative and collective activity to an individualistic, monetary activity.
  - Work become a commodity.

------

## Model of Managerial Control

------

### Scientific Management (Taylorism)

------

- A set of production methods, tools, and organizational systems designed to increase the efficiency of factory production. (Frederick W. Taylor).
- Taylor solution was to determine "scientifically" the one best way of performing a job through  *time and motion studies* of each step.
  - Detail implementation in Page 256.

------

### Edwards and Control

------

- With *simple control*, most common in secondary labour markets, employers regulate the labour process by using
  - coercive or paternalistic methods (force or authority)
  - bureaucratic hierarchy of authority (large organization)
- *Technical control* is achieved by machine pacing of work and can, in part, replace the direct supervision of simple control methods
  - assembly line in Henry Ford
- *Bureaucratic control* has evolved in large organization.
  - Good salaries, generous benefits, and pleasant work settings for middle- and upper level, white-collar employees and skilled manual workers.

------

### Gordon, Edwards, and Reich Argument

------

- The evolution of segmented labour markets resulted in a socially fragmented and politically weak working class.
- Employers gained the upper hand over workers by continually developing new and more effective means of control
- Critics: theory portrays workers as largely passive

------

### Frontier of Control

------

- influenced alternately by conflict and accommodation between employers and employees.
- Management may initiate some work reforms, giving workers calls *responsible autonomy* 
  - Ex: quality-of-working-life programs and other participative management schemes
- (autonomy - right of an organization to be independent and govern itself)

------

### Frontier of Control (Inco)

------

- Flatter job hierarchy
- Underground miners made their own decisions about how and when to complete various tasks.
- These changes can lead to a breakdown of traditional job autonomy and erosion of the bargaining power of unionized workers

------

### Frontier of Control (A nightclub in a western Canadian city)

------

- Strong informal workplace culture that had emerged in the club
- The great degree of job autonomy enjoyed by workers.

- It tried to take charge by implementing what might be seen as a system of responsible autonomy.
- Workers were put off by the training seminars, disliked the new system of job enlargement, and found that elimination of supervisors made their work more difficult.
- They actively resisted the changes, a direct and coercive control lead to job quitting and reduce in quality of service.

------

## Deskilling

------

- Deskilling has occurred in some specific occupations and work settings.
  - Supervisors subdivided the tasks -> mobile assembly line

### Harry Braverman

------

- Clerks processed an endless stream of paper on a white-collar assembly line.
- Routinized tasks devoid of much mental activity
  - Clerical work had been degraded and deskilled.
- Braverman attributed these changes to management strategies designed to improve efficiency an gain more control over the office labour process,
  - the same strategies employed in factories many decades earlier.
- Braverman believed that both lower- and higher-status , white-collar workers were becoming part of the same working class.
- The deskilling and degradation of work in general was setting the scene for future class conflict. 

------

### Critics On Harry Braverman

------

- **Over-generalized** from scattered evidence in NA to assert that deskilling was a universal pattern present in all occupations within all industrial capitalist societies.
- Important cultural differences in the labour process were ignored
  - automation, work reorganization, and management strategies provided more autonomy and responsibility to workers.
- Overlooked new skills required in industrial and postindustrial economies.
  - leadership skills
  - sophisticated "people skills" in service industries
  - efficient use of new manufacturing and IT required computer skills.
- Ignored gendered nature of workplace skills as well as how race and ethnicity have played a major part in labour markets.
- Implied that workers passively accepted management assaults on their job skills and autonomy.
- However, Braverman's book challenged work researchers to ask new questions about changes in the labour process in contemporary capitalist societies.

------

## Enskilling

------

- The growing number of multi-skilled workers required by 
  - flexible specialization, 
  - lean production, 
  - and other post-industrial modes of production, 
  - as well as by the proliferation of computers, robotics, and new IT in workplace.
- Rising levels of educational attainment (act of achieve something) among Canadians, in the absence of enough jobs requiring higher education and training, can lead to significant problems of underemployment.



- TQM, lean production, and other recent management innovations may require workers to learn additional skills
  - In downsized organizations, workers also have to work harder and faster, under more stressful conditions.



- Until then, growth in higher-skill jobs, most in the upper-tier services and the goods-producing industries, outstripped the expansion of less skilled positions, many in the lower-tier services.
  - continuity on industrial restructuring
  - organizational down-sizing
  -  widespread introduction of automated technologies, the sum of which might have slowed or stopped the enskilling trend. 

------

### Skill

------

- Jobs can be redesigned to increase or decrease skill content.
  - Workers can lose skills if they do not have the opportunity to use them regularly.
- Not all skills can be reliably measured and ranked in terms of their importance and complexity.
  - Informal knowledge gained from experience or from coworkers often go unrewarded.

------

## Technological, Economic, Social Determinism

------

### Technological Determinism

------

- The belief that the developmental pattern and effects of a given technology are 
  - universal and unalterable, 
  - removes the possibility of human agency,
  - the potential for people to shape technology for the greater social good
  - new technologies have been used in very different ways, with different outcomes, in different work settings and societies.
- Rejected

------

### Economic Determinism

------

- The belief that "market knows best" how to choose and implement new technologies.
- Such a perspective would argue that despite current problems with underemployment, deskilling, and loss of worker autonomy, new technologies will in time naturally lead to more positive than negative outcomes.
- But behind the "free hand of the market" are real people, making decisions about how to implement the new technologies.
  - These decisions typically have been made by owners and magagers.
- Rejected

------

### Social Determinism (Prefer)

------

- Advocating education, wide-ranging discussion, and open decision making about how technologies will be used, by whom and for whose benefit.
- Believe that technology should be used to serve individual, community, and societal needs, not merely the needs of a particular company or work organization.

------

## Downsizing

------

- Driven by economic downturns in the private sector and deficit-cutting agendas in the public sector.
- Job cuts, accompanied by organizational restructuring.
- Follow company mergers and subsequent large-scale reorganization of production.
- Extensive downsizing has continued in the 21st century.
  - off-shorig
  - relocation of jobs to other nation (China and India)
- Short-term cost savings with downsizing often do no translate into long-term improved profits
  - increase in expense from re-hire workers or contract-out work
  - weaken the social networks that are vital for the organization's capacity to learn and share knowledge.
- Negatively affects workers who lose their jobs and become unemployed.
  - health issues
  - *survivor syndrome*

- Staff reductions achieved by employees volunteering to leave can create new problems for work organizations
  - knowledge assets are depleted.

------

## Neo-Fordism

------

- Implying the positive change of participate management and employee empowerment have not been nearly as significant as their proponents claim.
- By offering some small concessions to workers, the new approaches have maintained the basic production framework and power structure of industrial capitalist society.

------

## Hyper-Taylorism

------

- Work intensification signals a new era of "management by stress" in which workers push themselves and each other to make more profits for their employees.
