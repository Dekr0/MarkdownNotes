# The Decision Matrix Exercises

2.1

|        | right number (1 /  38) | wrong number (37 / 38) |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| bet    | 35x                    | -x                     |
| no bet | 0                      | 0                      |



2.2

|                            | God exists                 | god doesn't exists            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| We believe God Exist       | gain eternity and infinity | gain nothing and lose nothing |
| We don't believe God exist | gain nothing               | gain nothing and lose nothing |



2.3

Even though the probability is extremely low, the probability of which god does in fact exist > 0.



2.4

Think in a different way : 

- a and b are two single OR bits that can have only two values : 0 and 1
- a = 0 => not getting stomach infection
- a' = 1 => getting stomach infection
- b = 0 => it is not too cold in Japan
- b' = 1 => it is too cold in Japan

- two bits => 4 states , $s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4$
  - ab, ab', a'b, a'b'



2.6

|      | s1   | s2   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| a1   | p    | q    |
| a2   | r    | s    |
| a3   | t    | u    |
