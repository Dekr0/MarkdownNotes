# The Philosophy Of Probability

## The classical Interpretation

------

-  **Fraction** of the **total number** of **possible ways** in which the event can occur.
- **Probability = Number of favorable cases / Number of possible cases** 
- Assumption : all possible outcomes are **equally** likely.
- Objection (Example) :
  - A biased coin / dice.
  - Possibility of someone fell in love with another person
  - Picking up the real number (2.35) from the set of real numbers between 2 and 3
- Solution to objection : it is always **possible** to **divide the set of cases** so as to all possible outcomes are equally likely.
- Conforms to the axioms of probability.

## The frequency interpretation

------

- **Ratio** between the number of **times** the event **has occurred** divided by the **total number** of **observed cases**.
- **Probability = Total number of positive instances / Total number of trials**
- There should **always** be a **reference class**.
- Objection :
  - It is not always possible to find a correct reference class and the size of reference class
- Venn argued that the frequency interpretation make sense **only if** the reference class is taken to be **infinitely large**.
- More precisely, Venn argued that one should distinguish sharply between the underlying ***limiting*** frequency of an event and the frequency ***observed*** so far.
- ***Limiting*** frequency is best though of as the proportion of successful outcomes one ***would*** get if one were to repeat ***one and the same*** experiment infinitely many times.
- To examine if this theory conforms to the axioms of probability.

## The propensity interpretation

------

- Probabilities refer to **certain features** of the **external world**.
- Propensity / Disposition / **Tendency** of an object to give rise to a certain effect.
- **Hybrid version**: The propensity of an object is taken into account when there is **no access** to **long-run frequencies**.
- **Pure version**: **Propensity** is the main issue in all the cases
- Objection : 
  - Problem of clarifying the concepts such as disposition and propensity.
- Particular objection : inverted possibility.
  - Propensities have a **temporal direction**
    - temporal : relating to practical matters or physical things.
  - If A has a propensity to give rise to B, A cannot occur after B
  - Propensities function very much like **causality**
    - **causality**  (因果关系) : the principle that there is a cause for everything that happens.
    - one event, process, state, or object contributes to the production of another event, process, state, or object.
  - If A causes B, then A cannot occur after B.
  - However, probabilities lack this temporal direction.

## Subjective Views

------

- Probability is the measure of an agent's **degrees of belief** in a statement regarding an event.
- For a partial belief to qualify as a **probability**, one's **degrees of belief** must be **rational**.
- Since subjective probabilities may vary from person to person
  - **Disagreement** concerning the probability of an event is normal.
- People can use Bayes' theorem to **update** their beliefs.
- Issues
  - The utility function is not **linear** for all people. 
  -  Not all people form their preferences in accordance with the principle of maximizing expected monetary value.

### Savage's Method

------

- A set of structural conditions on preferences over uncertain options
  - Apply restriction on what combinations of preferences are legitimate to have.
- Proves that if a decision maker's preferences over those options satisfy the axioms
- Behaves as if she were forming her preferences by first
  - assigning subjective probabilities
  - utilities to each option
  - maximizing expected utility

### The Dutch Book Method

------

- A Dutch Book is a combination of bets that is **certain to lead to a loss**.
- Violate the axioms of the probability calculus.
  - G V ~ G = 1
- The Dutch Book theorem states that a decision maker's degrees of belief **satisfy** the **probability axioms** if and only if **no Dutch Book** can be **made against** her.

- Assumption : decision maker's utility of money and other goods is linear.
- A *fair price* for a bet, is an amount such that the decision maker is equally willing to act
  -  as a player
  - as a bookie
- Exactly one fair price for every bet :
  - equally willing to buy or sell a bet costing $100.
  - preference must be altered if the price is changed to $101.
- Ratio between the fair price of a bet and the absolute value of the amount at stake is called the betting quotient.
  - stake: (share involvement in something such as a business)
- Decision maker has to announce his betting quotients for a fairly large  number of bets. (detailed 164).
