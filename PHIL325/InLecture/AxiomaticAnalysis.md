- -- $\rightarrow$ incompatible
- $\cross\rightarrow$ compatible
- $\bigotimes\rightarrow$ characterize



- To prove a rule / principle
  - The mathematical equations of a rule / principle can be proven by a set of axioms that is compatible, and characterize that rule.
- A set of axioms that characterize, and is used to prove a rule / principle must be difference between the set of axioms for other rules and principles (Re-watch lecture)



- Remark for *Irrelevant alternatives*
- Let's say $a_1 > a_2 > a_3$, insert $a_4$ 
  - It's plausible if $a_1>a_2>a_4>a_3$
  - It is not plausible if $a_2>a_1>a_4>a_3$
