# The Decision Matrix

- A *Decision problem* consists in the question of which act to choose, given a set of states, in order to obtain the best outcome.
- The only thing a decision maker have control at is acts.
- The ultimate goal is to find the best act.

------

#### Difference From Game Theory

------

- In game theory, a decision maker make decision based on the other decision maker(s) but that / these other decision makers **also make decision based on the decision maker**. So other decision makers cannot consider as states of world because it depends on acts of a decision maker

------

## States

------

- The state is what in the natural that determines the outcomes of your decision.
- The states should always be **independent** to acts otherwise the formalization of the decision problem is not correct.
- States should be chosen such that the **value** (probability) of the outcomes under all states is **independent** of **whether the state occurs or not**
  - Example : you are making bet that a surgery can be live or death. 

- The **importance** of state is to partition outcomes.

------

## Outcomes

------

- The ranking of outcomes is **subjective**.

------

### Ordinal Scales

------

- *Ordinal scales* is *qualitative comparison*. The number in that scale only **shows the order** of the outcome. It doesn't tell how much outcomes are difference to each other. 
  - The number **can be arbitrary** as long as the number in the scale **show the order** of the outcomes

------

### Cardinal Scales

------

- Both interval scales and ratio scales can be considered as ordinal scales.

------

## Acts

------

- An *act* is a *function* from a set of states to a  set of outcomes
  - primarily concerned with **particular** acts, rather than generic acts

------

### Alternative set

------

- Every member is a particular act
- It has at least two different members
- The members are agent-identical
- The members are time-identical
- The members are performable
- The members are incompatible in pairs
- The members are jointly exhaustive

------

## Rival Formalizations

------

- The problem of **rival formalizations** arises if  two or more formalizations are *equally reasonable* and strictly better than all alternatives

------

## Transformative decision rules

------

### The principle of insufficient reason

------

- If in a formal decision problem the probabilities of states are unknown, then it may be transformed into another formal decision problem in which **equal probabilities** are assigned to all states.
- This principle is not quiet satisfied

------

### Merger of states

------

- If **two or more** states yield **identical outcomes** under all acts, then those **repetitious states** should be **collapsed into one**, **if** the **probabilities** of the two states are **known** they should be added.
