- A *Decision problem* consists in the question of which act to choose, given a set of states, in order to obtain the best outcome.

- The only thing a decision maker have control at is acts.

- The ultimate gold is to find the best act.

- In game theory, a decision maker make decision based on the other decision maker(s) but that / these other decision makers **also make decision based on the decision maker**. So other decision makers cannot consider as states of world because it depends on acts of a decision maker

- The states should always be independent to acts otherwise the formalization of the decision problem is not correct.

- States should be chosen such that the value of the outcomes under all states is independent of whether the state occurs or not (?)
  - The point is that the probability of whether if the state happen should not tie with the value of the outcomes

- The importance of state is to partition outcomes.

- The ranking of outcomes is **subjective**.

- *Ordinal scales* is *qualitative comparison*. The number in that scale only **shows the order** of the outcome. It doesn't tell how much outcomes are difference to each other. 
  - The number **can be arbitrary** as long as the number in the scale **show the order** of the outcomes

- Both interval scales and ratio scales can be considered as ordinal scales.
