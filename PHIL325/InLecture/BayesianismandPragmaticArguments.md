# Bayesianism and Pragmatic Arguments

## Bayesianism

------

- **Bayesian decision theories** are formal theories of rational agency. They aim to tell us both:
  - what the properties of a rational state of mind are ...
    - *epistemic* component
    - what your state of mind ought to be like
  - what action it is rational for an agent to perform, give his / her state of mind.
    - *deliberative* component
    - how you ought to act given that state of mind
-  The axiomatic conditions on preferences employed in Bayesian theories merely restrict which combinations of preferences are legitimate.
  - Asymmetry
  - Transitivity
  - Completeness
  - etc.
- Preferences are revealed in one's choice behavior.
  - If the agent is offered a choice between two uncertain prospects and chooses one of them,
  - we may conclude that he / she preferred the chosen one.

------

### The epistemic component

------

- a claim about 
  - what rational agents ought to believe
  - which combinations of beliefs and desires are rationally permissible
- The theory holds that one is free to believe whatever one wishes *as long as* one's beliefs can be 
  - represented by a **subjective probability function**
  - and those beliefs are updated in accordance with ***Bayes' theorem***
- Virtually, it offers no substantial advice on *how* one ought to go about when exploring the world.
  - merely provides a set of structural restrictions on
    - what it's permissible to believe
    - how one is permitted to revise those beliefs with new info.
- A major issue of disagreement : how to determine ***prior probabilities***

------

### The deliberative component

------

- Tells the agent what it's rational to do given his / her present state of mind.

------

#### Principles

------

1. (Chapter 5) Subjective degrees of belief can be represented by 
   - a ***probability function*** defined in terms of the decision maker's preferences over uncertain prospects

2.  (Chapter 7) The decision maker's desires can be represented by
   - a **utility function** defined in terms of preferences over uncertain prospects
3. Rational decision makers act ***as if*** they maximize ***subjective expected utility***.

------

- Third principle : decision maker does *not* prefer an uncertain prospect to another *because* 
  - he / she judges the utilities and probabilities of the outcomes to be more favorable than those of another.
- The probability and utility functions are established by reasoning backwards :
  - since the agent preferred some uncertain prospects to others,
  - and the preferences over uncertain prospects satisfy a number of structural axioms,
  - the agent behaves as if ... (consistent with the principle of maximizing ...)

#### Establish equality between events

------

- Suppose that the agent strictly prefers one object

  - a fancy designer watch to another object.

- Then, if the agent is ***indifferent*** between the prospect in 

  1. she wins the first object if Event 1 occurs and the second object if Event 2 occurs
  2. she wins the second object if Event 1 occurs and the first object if Event 2 occurs
  3. two events are by definition equally probable.

  

- Examples : the agent considers the mutually exclusive events ***R*** and ***~ R*** to be equally probable.

- Then she will be indifferent between winning, say, 

  - 200 units of utility if ***R*** occurs and 100 units if ***~R*** occurs
  - 100 units of utility if ***R*** occurs and 200 units if ***~R*** occurs

## Pragmatic Arguments

------

- Bayesian decision theory are the transitivity, completeness and independence axioms.
  - Transitivity : If x > y and y > z, then x > z
  - Completeness : x > y or y > x or x ~ y
  - Independence : If x > y, then $xpz \succ ypz$
    - where $xpz$ is a lottery that gives you $x$ with probability $p$ and $z$ with probability 1 - $p$
- **Why Axioms ?**
  - One might claim they are intuitively true
    - If it was so, no disagreements could exist.
  - Logical or mathematical proofs cannot be provided.
  - The only resort is ***pragmatic justification***.
  - If your preferences don't satisfy the axioms, then you get into trouble.
- ***Pragmatic arguments*** seek to show that decision makers who **violate** certain principles of rationality may face a decision problem in which  it is ***certain*** that they will **stand to lost, come what may**
  - Need not always be formulated in monetary terms

------

### Money-pump Argument

------

- Preference between two objects is not ***asymmetric***
- The arguments shows that if a decision maker doesn't follow the principles of rational decision making,
- This person can be pumped all the money without getting anything back.
- At the end of each stage, that person is back the beginning, the only difference being that that person lost some money.

------

### Must a Rational Preference be Transitive ?

------

- The pragmatic argument for transitivity seeks to show that 
  - anyone whose preferences are **cyclic** (and hence not transitive) 
  - may end up in a situation in which it is **certain** that she will lose an infinite amount of money.

------

#### Argument

------

- Imagine that your preference ordering over the three novels x, y and z is cyclic.
- You prefer x to y, and y to z, and z to x
  - x > y > z > x.
- Now suppose that you are in possession of z, and that you are invited to swap z for y.
- Because you prefer y to z, it is rational for you to swap even if you have pay to *small* amount, say one cent, for swapping.
- So you swap, and tempoarily get y.
- You are then invited to pay one cent for swapping y for x, which you do, because you prefer x to y.
- Finally, you are offered to pay one cent for swapping x for z. 
- Because z is strictly better than x, even after you have paid the fee for swapping, rationality tells you that you should accept the offer.
- This means that you end up where you started, the only difference being that you now have three cents less.
- This procedure is thereafter iterated over and over again. After a billion cycles you go bankrupts.

- Conclusion is ***not*** that a rational preference must be transitive.
- The conclusion is rather that if we permit cyclic preference orderings, then the contradiction in the ***money pump argument*** is unavoidable.

- What if x > y and y > z, then x and z to be incommensurable
  - ordering is not cyclic
  - it is not certain that that person can be money pumped.
  - Hence, it's difficult to see how the money pump argument could support the transitivity axiom.
- What makes a cyclic preference irrational is not that the agent can be exploited
  - rather the fact that she is ***acting against her own preference***
  - "What is irrational about being money pumped is that one chooses against oneâ€™s preference ... Whether someone else thereby gets rich at your expense is irrelevant for whether you are rational" (Johan Gustafsson)

------

### Must a Rational Preference be Complete ?

------

- The **completeness axiom** - holding that a rational decision maker must either 
  - prefer one object to another 
  - or be indifferent between the two
- **Completeness axiom** entails that any pair of objects, no matter how disparate, can be compared. 
  - You must either prefer one to the other, or be indifferent between the two.
- The axiom can be violated if one holds that there are pair of options that  are **incommensurable**
  - **Incommensurability** is irrational.
- If it is rationally permissible to swap between two incommensurable objects, then it is easy to construct a money pump.
  - If one denies that it is permissible to swap, it would no longer be possible to construct this kind of money pump.

------

#### Small Improvement Argument

------

- When an agent A doesn't prefer x to y nor y to x
- It follows from the completeness axiom that A is indifferent between x and y.
- If x and y are equally valuable, then adding a small amount of value to x would make A ready to preferer x over y. 
- But this not the case in many situations. So indifference is not the only alternative to x > y and y > x. (Proof Page 185.)

------

#### Paul Samuelson's Revealed Preference Theory

------

- A forceful objection to the small improvement argument.
