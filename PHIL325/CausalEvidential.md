# Causal And Evidential Decision Theory

## Newcomb's problem

---

- There are two boxes on the table:
  - B1 contains \$1000 and you know this
  - B2 contains either \$1M or nothing.
- You are now invited to make a choice between the following pair of alternatives:
  - A1: Take both B1 and B2
  - A2: Take only B2
- Imagine a being who is very good at predicting other people's choices.
  - 99 % of all predictions made by him / her so far have been correct.
- You are told that he / she will put \$1M in B2
  - if and only if she predicts that you take just B2,
  - and nothing otherwise.
  - He / She knows that you know this.
- Using Dominance Prcinciple
  - Choose A1.
  - You don't have to be worried about the predictor's prediction.
  - She has made her prediction and put either \$1M or nothing in B2.
  - When you are to choose,  she cannot chnage what she has put in B2.
- Using the principle of maximizing expected utility
  - Choose A2.
  - u(A1) > u(A2)
- The predictor does not has magical powers, or he / she can change the past.
- What we know is only that his / her previous predictions were almost always right.

## Causal Decision Theory

---

- A rational decision maker should 
  - keep all her beliefs about causal processes **fixed** in the decision-making process,
  - and always choose an alternative that is optimal **according to these beliefs** 
- The causal structure of the world is **forward-looking**, and completetly insensitive to past events.
- Maximize expected causal consequences.
- Example : 
  - If eating an apple will cause you to be happy 
  - and eating an orange will cause you to be sad 
  - then you would be ration to eat the apple.
  - But what if eating a good will cause you to be happy,
  - and eating a bad apple will cause you to be sad
  - but you aren't sure if the apple is good or bad.
- (Only) consider $X\square \to Y$
  - Indicative mood $P\to Q$
    - False when P is T and Q is F.

  - Subjunctive mood $P\square \to Q$
    - False when in the closet possible world in which P is T Q is F.

## Evidential Decision Theory

---

- Pressing the button does not cause any psychiatric disase,

- but if you were to press the button you would indirectly learn something about yourself,

  - that you did not already know, namely that you are a psychopath.

- It is not p($X\square\to Y$) that should guide one's decision but rather $p((X \square \to Y)|X)$.
