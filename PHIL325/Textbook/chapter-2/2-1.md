## States
---

- Intuitively, a state is a part of the world that is not an *outcome* or an *act*.
  - that can be performed by the agent in the present decision situation
    - perform - to do an action or piece of work
  - i.e, an agent can use it to do an action or piece of work (perform) 

---

### Alternative point of view

---

- Sometimes we should also think of the **outcome** brought about **by an act** as a state of the world.

- An act is **essentially** *a device* that *transforms* one state of the world into *another state*.

- **Remark** : it will be **helpful** to keep **apart** states and outcomes in the present discussion.

---

- Not all states are relevant to decision making.

- Only states that *may affect* the decision maker's **preference** among *acts* need to be taken into account.
  - Example, page 20

---
### Illegitimate partition of states
---

- Whether the state will occur **must not depends** on which act you choose.
  - Example, page 20.

---
#### Independent States
---

- First option is to include only states that are causally **independent of the acts** in the formalization.

---
#### Avoid The Notion of States
---

- Second option is to *avoid* the *notion of states* altogether.
   
- This works particularly well if all the probability of the outcomes are known.
  - Example, page 21, Table 2.4
    
- This makes little sense in other decision problems (under ignorance).
