## The Decision Matrix
---
- Relevant *acts, states, and outcomes* need to be **specify** and **determined** before making a decision

- A formal representation, a model, for a decision problem is essential

### Decision Tree
---

- An alternative way to visualize information other than decision matrix. 

- Decision trees are often used for representing **sequential decisions**, decisions that are divided into several separate steps.

- **Square** = *choice node*. At the choice node, the decision maker decides whether to go *up* or *down* in the tree.
  - If there are more than two acts to choose from, adds more lines

- **Circiles** = *chance node*. At the chance nodes, nature decides which line to follow.

- The leaf node represent the possible outcomes.

- To represent a sequential decision problem in a tree, one simply adds new choice and chance nodes to the right of the existing leavs.

### Abstraction
---

1. *The decision problem* is constituted b the enetities of the world that prompt the decision maker **to make a choice**, or are otherwise relevant to that choice.

2. A **formalization** of a decision problem is made up of information about the decision to be made (regardless visualization of information).
   - comprises informatoin about *acts*, *states*, and *outcomes* (and probabilities).
   - multiple formalizations but not all of them are good

3. Any given set of information can be visualized in different ways (less interesting than how to formalize decision problems).
