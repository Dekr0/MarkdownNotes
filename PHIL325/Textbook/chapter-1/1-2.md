## Rational and Right Decisions
- A decision can be rational **without being right** and right **without being rational**.
  - Example in page 4

- Act is right until the decision has already been made.

- It is always possible to forsee whether a decision is rational because theories of rationality operate on information available at the point in time the decision is made, rather than on information available at some later point in time.
  
- A decision is *right* if and only if its actual outcome is ata least as good as that of every other possible outcome.

- A decision is *rational* if and only if the decision maker chooses to do what he / she has most reason to do at the point in time at which the decision is made.

- *Instrumental rationality* presupposes that the decision maker has some *aim* (goal).
  - *Aim* is external to decision theory.
    - It cannot in itself be irrational although sets of aims can sometimes be irrational, they are mutually inconsistent.

- To be instrumental rational is to do whatever one has most reason to expect will fuifill one's aim.
