## Relational (Data) Model
---
### Data Model

- Data model, a way to describe the **structure** of our data
    - Example - (name, age, phone) 
    - How can / shall we structure our data ?

---

### Relation

- Relation is a subset of **cartesian product** of two sets.
  - This holds more than two sets.
  - A relation between two sets is a binary relation.
  - A relation between n sets is a n-ary relation.
  - We may refer a single set as a relation.

---

#### Example

- Set "make" = (Toyota, Honda, Ford) and Set "model" = (Coralla, Civi, Focus).

- A relation between these two sets is the subset of "make" $\cdot$ "model" :
  - (Toyota, Corolla)
  - (Honda, Civic)
  - (Ford, Focus)

### Relation ~ Table

- It include constraints

---

### Questions ?

- How to create, query, manipulate relations ? **SQL**

- What type of useful constraints are useful or meaningful ?

- How can we build higher level abstractions above relation ? **Views**
