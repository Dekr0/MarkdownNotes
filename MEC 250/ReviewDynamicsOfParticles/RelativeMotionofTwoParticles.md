# Relative-Motion of Two Particles

- There are many cases, where the path of motion for a particle is complicated, 
- so that it may be easier to analyze the motion in parts by using two or more frames of reference

---

## Translating Axes

---

- B relative to A : B/A
- A relative to B : A/B

---

### Position

---

- Detail (Page 116)

- The origin of a second frame of reference $x', y', z'$ is attached to and moves with particle *A*
  - *only permitted to translate relative* to the fixed frame
- $\boldsymbol{r}_{B/A}$ - *relative -position vector*
