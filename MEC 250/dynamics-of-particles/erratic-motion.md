# Erratic Motion

- When a particle has erratic or changing motion then 
  - its position, velocity and acceleration *cannot* be described by **a single** continuous mathematical **function** along the entire path
  - instead, a series of functions will be required
- If a graph of the motion that **relates any two** of the variables ($s,v,a,t$) can be drawn,
  - this graph can be used to construct subsequent graphs relating two other variables (differential relationships)

## The s-t, v-t, and a-t Graphs

---

- slope of s-t graph = velocity, $\frac{ds}{dt}=v$
- slope of v-t graph = acceleration, $\frac{dv}{dt}=a$
- change in velocity = area under a-t graph, $\Delta v=\int{a}\space dt$
- displacement = area under v-t graph, $\Delta s=\int{v}\space dt$
