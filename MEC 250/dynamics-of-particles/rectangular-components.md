# Rectangular Components

- Occasionally the motion of a particle can best be described along a path that can be expressed in terms of its **x, y, z** coordinates.
- Position - location of the particle is defined by the *position vector*, **r**
- Direction of **v** and **a** are defined by its **vector** over its magnitude (square root of sum of the square of each component)

## Important Points

---

- Curvilinear motion can cause changes in *both*  the magnitude and direction of the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors.
- The velocity vector is **always directed** *tangent* to the path.
- In general, the acceleration vector is *not tangent to the path*, but rather, it's tangent to the hodograph (速端曲线).
- If the motion is described using rectangular coordinates, 
  - then the components along each of the axes do not change direction,
  - only their magnitude and sense (sign) will change.
- By considering the component motions, 
  - the change in magnitude and direction of the particle's position and velocity are automatically taken into account.

## Procedure for Analysis

---

- Since *rectilinear motion* occurs along *each coordinate axis*, 

  - the motion along each axis is found using 
    - $v = ds / dt$
    - $a = dv / dt$
    - or $a \space ds = v \space dv$

- In two dimensions, the equation of the path $y=f(x)$ can be used to relate the $x$ and $y$ components of velocity and acceleration (chain rule).

- Once the $x, y, z$ components of **v** and **a** have been determined,

  - magnitudes of these vectors are found from the Pythagorean theorem. (B-3)

  - coordinate direction angles from the components of their unit vectors (B-4 and B-5)

    - $\boldsymbol{u}_A = \frac{A_x}{A}\boldsymbol{i} + \frac{A_y}{A}\boldsymbol{j} + \frac{A_z}{A}\boldsymbol{k}$

    - $\cos \alpha = \frac{A_x}{A}$

    - $\cos \beta = \frac{A_y}{A}$

    - $\cos \gamma = \frac{A_z}{A}$
