# Linear Impulse And Momentum

## Principle of Linear Impulse and Momentum

---

- Integrate the equation of motion ($\sum F = m\frac{dv}{dt}$) with respect time to
  - same inertial frame of reference

- The equation provides a *direct means* of obtaining the particle's final velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_2$ after a specified time period 
  - when its initial velocity is known
  - and the forces acting on the particle.

---

### Linear Momentum

---

- $\boldsymbol{L} = m \boldsymbol{v}$ , particle's linear momentum
- Linear-momentum vector has the same direction as $\boldsymbol{v}$

---

### Linear Impulse

---

- $\boldsymbol{I}=\int \boldsymbol{F}dt$, *linear impulse*
- Vector quantity
- Time is constant, thus, impulse acts in the same direction as the force 

---

### Alternate form

---

- $m\boldsymbol{v}_1+\sum\int_{t_1}^{t_2}Fdt=m\boldsymbol{v}_2$
- initial momentum of the particle at time $t_1$ plus 
- the sum of all impulses applied to the particle from $t_1$ to $t_2$
- => final momentum of the article time $t_2$
