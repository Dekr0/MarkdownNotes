# Linear Impulse And Momentum

## Principle of Linear Impulse and Momentum

---

- Integrate the equation of motion ($\sum F = m\frac{dv}{dt}$) with respect time to
- The equation provides a *direct means* of obtaining the particle's final velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_2$ after a specified time period 
  - when its initial velocity is known
  - and the forces acting on the particle.

### Linear Momentum

---

- $\boldsymbol{L} = m \boldsymbol{v}$ , particle's linear momentum
- Linear-momentum vector has the same direction as $\boldsymbol{v}$
