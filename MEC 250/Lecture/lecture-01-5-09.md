# Lecture 1

- Choose the desired coordinate system based on the type of questions
- Unit of vector
  - the unit vector is fixed for x, y, z coordinate system (**i**, **j**, **k**) regardless the position of the particle
    - $\frac{di}{dt} = 0$
    - $\frac{dj}{dt} = 0$
  - the unit vector depends on the position of the particle
- $R\ddot\theta = a_t$, tangential (transverse) component
- $-R (\dot \theta)^2 = a_n$, normal component

---

#### Assignment Question 1

- $(a_t)_B=0.5e^t = R\ddot\theta$

  - Integrate both side with $\dot \theta|_{t=0} = 0$
    - $R \dot \theta = (0.5e^t-0.5)$
- Integrate once more to obtain $\theta(t)$
